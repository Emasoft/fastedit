Every assertion compares raw BYTES (never decoded strings) so that

    the now-dangling separator blank lines when the deleted symbol ran to EOF,
    arguing they had nothing left to separate. It was DROPPED, because it popped
    entries off a list that includes original_lines[:start_idx] -- the PRESERVED
    PREFIX, i.e. bytes before the deleted span. Measured consequence: six
    byte-exactness tests in the encoding-matrix and CRLF-preservation suites went
    red, because on a CRLF file those trailing blanks are carriage-return entries
    and the preserved prefix stopped matching the original bytes.
    The rule this encodes: delete may consume the separator that FOLLOWS a
    removed symbol (that whitespace is part of the deleted region), but may never
    touch bytes BEFORE it. A file left ending in blank lines is untidy, not
    corrupt; a tool that silently rewrites bytes you did not ask it to change is
    the defect this whole suite exists to catch.
