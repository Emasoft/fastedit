"""Issue #8: markdown ``--replace`` tail drops + ``fastedit diff`` coverage.

Part (a): a snippet restating a section's heading + SOME body lines but
ending MID-SENTENCE (its final line is a strict prefix of an original body
line) used to land as a direct swap: the text-match editor declined the
shape (leading-token rewrite conflict), and the completeness check for
format symbols only COUNTED declared-vs-deleted content lines — the
truncated line counted as a new line covering the deletion, so the tail
(``... config is valid.``) was dropped with exit 0.

Part (b): ``fastedit diff`` diffed the current file against the NEWEST
backup (``BackupStore.peek``), i.e. against the LAST edit's pre-state. A
loss from an EARLIER edit vanished from the diff as soon as any later edit
landed — the diff showed only the newest intended hunk. The diff base is
now the OLDEST surviving backup, so the rendered diff covers every change
still in the undo history (context n stays the standard 3: adjacent hunks
merge automatically, distant hunks each print in full — every changed line
appears as a removal or addition either way; the base, not the context,
was the gap).
