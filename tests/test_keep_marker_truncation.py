"""Regression tests for TRDD-CMRMA2YG (fastedit edit --replace silent truncation).

`_try_deterministic_replace`'s direct-replacement fallback used to assume "the
snippet IS the new symbol" and splice it verbatim over the symbol's line range.
A snippet containing a keep-marker (`#...`, `//...`, ...) is NOT a complete
symbol -- the marker stands in for lines the author deliberately omitted -- so
splicing it verbatim silently deleted those lines while still exiting 0. These
tests pin the fix: `snippet_has_keep_marker` refuses the unsafe case with a
clean CLI error and leaves the file byte-for-byte unchanged, while every
legitimate case (trailing marker via the deterministic merge path, real code
that merely contains marker-like text, non-Python languages, and a bare `...`
Python stub body) keeps working.

    MEASURED code-loss regression, and the fifth distinct shape to reach the

    The rule: an apostrophe opens a string only when a partner appears later on
    the SAME line, so a genuine char literal still counts and a lifetime does not.
