"""Regression matrix for VAL-001: hallucination validator fidelity.

Issue #3 / VAL-001: the validator must accept a faithful line-replacing
merge and reject variants that

    * delete unrelated code,
    * omit required snippet code,
    * duplicate or reorder code,
    * invent content,
    * leak a marker, or
    * mishandle repeated identical lines via set collapse instead of
      multiplicity.

The validator under test is the private ``_check_hallucinations`` helper
in :mod:`fastedit.inference.chunked_merge`. It returns a float in
``[0.0, 1.0]``; downstream code retries when the score is below ``0.85``
and rejects the chunk entirely when it is below ``0.5``. These tests
treat any score at or above ``0.85`` as ACCEPT and anything strictly below
``0.85`` as REJECT, matching the production policy.

The exact issue #3 reproduction is a one-line return-value replacement:

    def foo():
        x = 1
        return x        <- original
        -> return x + 1 <- intent

The previous implementation scored this faithful merge ``0.0``, triggered
two model calls, rejected the chunk, and left the original file
unchanged. The tests below codify the behaviour the fix must satisfy.

# order. The cases below pin the corrected behaviour:
#
#   * a marker at the END of a hunk is a preservation wildcard for the
#     original lines that follow the last context anchor — they MUST
#     appear in the merge in order, with multiplicity. Lines that the
#     snippet did NOT declare as a replacement MUST NOT be deleted;
#   * a marker at the START of a hunk is a preservation wildcard for
#     the original lines that come before the first context anchor;
#   * when the snippet only anchors the signature (line 0) and uses a
#     single marker, new lines are insertions, not replacements;
#   * new lines declared by the snippet must appear in the merge in
#     snippet order (the order check is on the snippet's new lines,
#     not on the original's preserved lines).
#
# These four properties together close the gap that the previous
# validator left open.

#     insertion — it must precede EVERY surviving original in the segment;

# ``deterministic_edit`` emits top-insertions before the preserved gap and
# bottom-insertions after it (see the parity matrix above), so a faithful
# merge always satisfies this invariant. The round-2 validator compared the
# new-vs-new order and the survivor-vs-survivor order independently but

# survivors, so a new line teleported to the wrong side of a preserved gap
# still scored a clean 1.0. The three ``*_wrong_*`` cases below are the
