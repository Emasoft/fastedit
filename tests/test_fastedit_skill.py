"""Accuracy and conciseness tests for the fastedit agent skill.

Contract (skills/fastedit/SKILL.md):
  - The file exists and its YAML frontmatter parses: name == 'fastedit' and a
    description that is present, mentions fastedit, and fits the skills-CLI
    limit of 1024 characters.
  - Every `fastedit ...` command line inside the skill's fenced code blocks is
    accepted by the REAL argparse parser built by fastedit.cli.main() — the
    same no-invented-flags guarantee tests/test_cli_help.py gives the --help
    guide. Parse-only: nothing is executed or written.
  - The file stays <= 200 lines so the skill stays concise enough for an agent
    to load whole.
  - DRIFT GUARD: src/fastedit/skill/SKILL.md — the packaged copy that ships in
    the wheel and that `fastedit init` stages for `npx skills add` — is
    byte-identical to this repo skill (the single source of truth), is a real
    file, is readable via importlib.resources, and is listed in pyproject's
    sdist include whitelist.
