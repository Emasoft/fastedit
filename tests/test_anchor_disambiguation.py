"""Step 17 — anchor disambiguation regressions (B24, B27, B28).

B24 — text_match bound each snippet context line to the FIRST forward
  original occurrence whose indent delta stayed within ±2 of the previous
  anchor's delta. A confidently-wrong-but-consistent repeat (``x = 1`` in
  two functions, a repeated ``return``) dragged the whole edit to the
  wrong region. The binding must consider ALL forward occurrences and
  prefer the one that keeps the snippet's anchor SEQUENCE contiguous with
  its neighbors AND matches the snippet line's indent; when two bindings
  remain equally valid the editor must DECLINE (return None) instead of
  silently picking the first.

B27 — ``_narrow_large_node`` accepted a sliding-window match at a stripped
  score as low as 0.2 and then cut ±padding RAW lines around it — mid-block
  cuts hand the model broken code to "repair". The acceptance threshold is
  a named tunable ≥ 0.6, and cuts happen at AST node edges (the enclosing
  block from the tree-sitter walk); without AST evidence the narrow is
  rejected (full node returned).

B28 — ``_find_insertion_region`` matched each context line to its FIRST
  occurrence and took ``max()`` as the anchor, so a common line steered
  the insertion anywhere. The anchor must be the RAREST context line
  (least frequent, then longest normalized content), and ALL context
  lines must land inside one consistent region — otherwise no region is
  returned and the caller's fallback runs.
