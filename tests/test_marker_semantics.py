"""Marker semantics across the merge pipeline (B16 + the B20 splice half).

Section layout (later steps append their own section to this file, per the
implementation plan):

  Section 1 — Step 12: the ``after=`` fast path in ``chunked_merge``

  Section 2 — Step 13 (placeholder): markers/strings/indent semantics
  (B17 remainder, B18, B7, B30, B33 land here later).

===========================================================================
Section 1 — Step 12: the ``after=`` fast path
===========================================================================

The ``after=`` path splices the snippet VERBATIM after an anchor symbol
with zero model tokens. Two defects are covered here:

* **B16 — marker leakage.** A preservation marker inside the snippet was
  written into the file as a literal comment line. It parses as a comment,
  so nothing downstream ever objects — silent corruption. Markers are
  merge directives, never content: the splice must drop them (logging the
  drop), and a snippet made ONLY of markers must fail loudly instead of
  silently reporting a successful no-op (CLAUDE.md: fail loudly, never
  silently write garbage).

* **B20 (splice half) — bare-LF pieces.** The splice hardcoded ``"\n"``
  separators and never normalized the snippet's own terminators,
  introducing bare-LF pieces into CRLF files (mixed-ending seams). The
  inserted piece must carry the ORIGINAL's line-ending convention. The
  central EOL normalizer over every return path is Step 14; this section
  only stops the ``after=`` path from INTRODUCING bare-LF pieces.

All tests drive the PUBLIC entry point :func:`chunked_merge` with a
``merge_fn`` that fails loudly if the model is ever invoked (the after=
path is zero-token). No network, no model download, no disk reads outside
``tmp_path``.
