# Install the `fastedits` CLI from this fork — or revert to upstream.
#
# ONE installer, two forward modes:
#
#   default (fork)  install from the fork's git repo, pinned to --ref.
#   --dev           install EDITABLE from this repo's working tree, so local
#                   changes take effect without reinstalling. For development.
#
# How the mode is chosen:
#   interactive (terminal on stdin): you are ASKED — "[1] local working tree
#     (editable) [2] remote GitHub fork". A standalone copy of this script
#     (curl|bash, no fastedit clone next to it) has no local tree to offer,
#     so it skips the menu and installs from the fork, saying so in one line.
#   non-interactive: no menu; --dev decides, otherwise the remote fork.
#   --revert never shows the menu.
#
# In fork mode, run from inside a clone, the ref defaults to THAT CLONE's
# current branch (`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`) and — on a real run —
# is verified to exist on the fork remote (`git ls-remote --heads`, bounded)
# before anything is touched; a missing branch aborts loudly listing the
# remote's actual heads. An explicit --ref overrides autodetect (and skips
# the check: it may name a tag or a sha, which --heads cannot see).
#
# This fork is deliberately NOT published to PyPI (PyPI stays upstream's
# release channel). Fork mode IS the fork's distribution mechanism: it
# points `uv tool install` at the fork's git repo instead.
#
# The fork and upstream share the same PyPI name (`fastedits`) and the
# same console-script names (fastedit, fastedit-hook, fastedit-mcp), so
# a leftover install from ANY method collides with the one this script
# just installed, and whichever sits first on PATH silently wins. That is
# why the preflight below reports every installed fastedits (uv tool /
# pipx / pip, plus which fastedit binary wins on PATH right now), the
# sweep uninstalls every method, and the postflight step resolves the
# binary that will actually run and confirms it is the fork, not just
# that *a* fastedit exists somewhere.
#
# Model caches under ~/.cache/fastedit/models are reported as VALID
# (holds *.safetensors) or STALE (a partial download). VALID caches are
# kept — they are shared between fork and upstream. STALE caches are
# removed (asked on a terminal [Y/n]; removed by default without one) so
# the next pull reinstalls cleanly. --revert keeps every cache: it never
# touches model weights (existing contract).
#
# After the package is in place, the installer also installs the repo's agent
# skill (skills/fastedit) with the Vercel skills CLI, FROM THIS CLONE'S
# WORKING TREE — the same skill content the package ships. GitHub sources
# (the repo shorthand and tree URLs) would resolve the fork's default branch
# (main), which still carries the legacy claude-skill content, so the local
# tree is the only correct source. The skill is an add-on, not the product: a
# missing npx or a failed skill install only warns (--no-skill skips the axis
# entirely; --revert removes the skill best-effort).

Usage: install-dev.sh [--dev] [--ref REF] [--extras LIST] [--all-grammars yes|no]
                      [--no-skill] [--revert] [--no-model] [--dry-run]

  --dev          Development install: EDITABLE, from this repo's working tree
                 (the directory the script lives in). Your local changes are
                 picked up without reinstalling. Cannot be combined with
                 --revert. Skips the source menu.
  --ref REF      Branch, tag or commit SHA of the fork to install. No effect
                 with --dev. Without --ref in fork mode, a run from inside a
                 clone installs THAT CLONE's current branch (verified to
                 exist on the fork remote); a standalone run keeps the
                 built-in default (feat/create-file).
  --extras LIST  Comma-separated extras. DEFAULT: every extra this platform
                 can install (mlx,mcp on Apple Silicon; vllm,mcp on Linux with
                 an NVIDIA driver; mcp elsewhere). Pass --extras "" for none --
                 the model pull is then skipped, since nothing could load it.
  --all-grammars yes|no
                 Install (yes) or skip (no) the offline 173-language grammar
                 pack (the `all-grammars` extra) without being asked. When the
                 flag is not passed the script ASKS (Enter = yes); with no
                 terminal on stdin it defaults to yes and says so.
  --no-skill     Skip the agent skill entirely: nothing is installed by the
                 forward modes, and --revert does not try to remove it.
  --revert       Uninstall the fork and reinstall upstream fastedits
                 from PyPI (undoes the swap; leaves downloaded model
                 weights in place — they're shared with the fork).
                 Also removes the globally installed agent skill
                 (best-effort; skipped when npx is missing or --no-skill
                 was passed). Never asks about grammars and never
                 installs them.
  --no-model     Skip downloading the merge model (~3 GB). The stale
                 model-cache cleanup below still runs. Ignored with
                 --revert, which never touches the model.
  --dry-run      Print the commands that would run; execute nothing
                 (model caches are reported, never removed)
  -h, --help     Show this help

Source menu: on an interactive run (terminal on stdin) with neither --dev nor
--revert, and this script sitting inside a fastedit clone, you are asked
"Install from: [1] local working tree (editable, tracks your changes) [2]
remote GitHub fork (pinned branch)" — Enter = 1, the detected local tree.
A standalone run (curl|bash, no clone next to the script) skips the menu and
installs from the remote fork. Without a terminal: --dev decides, otherwise
the remote fork.

Preflight: before installing, the script reports every installed fastedits
(uv tool, pipx, pip — plus which fastedit binary wins on PATH right now) and
every model cache under ~/.cache/fastedit/models (VALID = holds
*.safetensors). VALID caches are kept — shared between fork and upstream.
STALE (partial) caches are removed so the next pull reinstalls cleanly:
asked on a terminal [Y/n], removed by default without one, printed as
"would remove" by --dry-run. --revert keeps every cache.

Agent skill: after the package install, the script also installs the agent
skill with the Vercel skills CLI, from THIS clone's working tree — the same
skills/fastedit directory the package is built from:
  npx --yes skills add <repo_root>/skills/fastedit -g -a claude-code -y
(global, non-interactive, Claude Code target; the path IS the skill, and
--ref never affects it — no GitHub source is involved, because the repo
shorthand and tree URLs would resolve the fork's default branch (main),
which still carries the legacy claude-skill content). A missing npx prints a
one-line manual-install note and a failed install only warns — neither ever
fails the installer. The postflight reports the axis truthfully:
"agent skill: installed (Claude Code, global)" / "agent skill: NOT FOUND
(see warnings above)" / "agent skill: skipped (...)". --revert removes the
skill best-effort with "npx --yes skills remove fastedit -g -y".
