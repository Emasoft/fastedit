"""Cross-process edit locking — one fastedit instance per file at a time.

The gap this closes: every previous guard was IN-PROCESS. ``_atomic_write``'s
expected-stat guard (B37) and the MCP server's ``file_locks`` asyncio locks
serialize writers inside one process, but a CLI run and an MCP server (or two
CLIs) editing the same file interleave whole read-merge-write cycles, and the
second silently destroys the first's change. ``acquire_edit_lock`` is the
cross-process counterpart, held across each file's read→merge→write window.

WHY FLOCK, NOT O_EXCL LOCKFILES
    The lock is ``flock(2)`` (POSIX) / ``msvcrt.locking`` (Windows) on a
    central lock file — the KERNEL owns the lock, so it is released when the
    holder dies for any reason, crash included. There is NO stale-lock
    problem by construction, which is exactly what an O_EXCL create-step
    lockfile cannot promise: its creator's death strands the marker file
    forever, and every later run must guess whether the holder is alive.

NEVER UNLINK THE LOCK FILE
    Release is unlock + close ONLY. Deleting the file is the classic
    unlink race: a waiter blocked on the old inode and a fresh creator of a
    same-named file would both believe they hold the lock. The files are
    permanent, ever-reusable rendezvous points (one per target path,
    ``<sha256(realpath)>.lock`` under ``~/.fastedit/locks/`` — central, like
    BackupStore, and never inside the user's tree). Their content —
    ``pid=<pid>\\nstarted=<epoch>\\n`` — is a courtesy stamp for the refusal
    message, never the lock itself.

REENTRANCY REGISTRY
    flock excludes per open-file-description, so two fds of the SAME process
    conflict with each other — a nested acquire (multi-edit's phases, MCP +
    CLI sharing one process) would deadlock against itself. A process-level
    registry maps realpath → held record: a same-process re-acquire is a
    no-op returning the existing record, and only the OUTERMOST release
    unlocks.
