    Prevents corrupt files if the process is interrupted mid-write.

    If *backups* is provided and the file already exists, the current file's
    RAW BYTES are stored as a NEW timestamped backup before overwriting
    (B22: no decode anywhere in the backup path, so a latin-1 file's backup
    is byte-exact regardless of codec; B38: consecutive edits stack instead
    of overwriting each other). This enables N-deep undo via ``fast_undo`` /
    ``fastedit undo``. Backups persist to disk (~/.fastedit/backups/).

    *content* may be str (every caller except duplicate/undo) or bytes (used
    by ``fastedit duplicate`` for a byte-for-byte copy that never decodes
    the source, and by undo, which restores the stored raw backup bytes
    verbatim). str content is encoded with *encoding* (B23) -- the SAME
    codec that decoded the file, passed down by every edit verb from its
    ``read_source`` call, so untouched bytes round-trip exactly. The default
    remains "utf-8" for callers that have no read-time codec. bytes content
    is written as-is: no BOM restore, no re-encoding.

    A UTF-8 BOM is a file-level marker, not line content: every write verb
    funnels its final write through here, so restoring a BOM the on-disk
    file already had -- when *content* is str and did not already keep
    it -- is done once, here, rather than in every caller. This matters
    because a merge/replace/delete/move touching the symbol at the very
    top of the file naturally rewrites line 1 as ordinary text and has no
    reason to know a BOM was riding on it; str content is the only case
    this applies to (bytes content is never touched).
    A "-sig" *encoding* supplies its own BOM at encode time; a leading
    U+FEFF still present in the text would encode as a SECOND BOM, so it
    is stripped first (the codec restores the marker).

    *expected_stat* (B37 lost-update guard) is the ``os.stat_result``
    captured from the SAME open the caller read the file through -- see
    ``io_utils.read_source(..., return_stat=True)``. When provided, the
    destination is re-stat'ed immediately BEFORE ``os.replace``: if its size
    or ``st_mtime_ns`` no longer match -- something else wrote the file in
    the read-to-write window -- the write is refused with
    ``ConcurrentModificationError`` and the destination is untouched. A
    destination that no longer exists is a concurrent modification too
    (this write would otherwise resurrect it). ``None`` (the default) skips
    the guard, preserving the behavior for callers with no read-time stat
    (new files, undo).

    Before creating its own temp, crashed-run residue for THIS target --
    ``.{path.name}.<random8>.tmp`` files at least ``_TEMP_MIN_AGE_SECS`` old
    in the destination's directory -- is swept (best-effort, logged; see
    :func:`_sweep_stale_temps`). A SIGKILL bypasses every exception-path
    unlink, so this is the only cleanup those temps ever get.
