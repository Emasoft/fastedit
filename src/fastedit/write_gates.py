"""Shared per-file write gates for the chunk-rejection convention.

Step 18 (B34) extracted the MCP edit tools' hallucination gate so every
fastedit surface — MCP ``fast_edit``/``fast_batch_edit``/``fast_multi_edit``
and the CLI's ``edit``/``batch-edit``/``multi-edit`` model paths — enforces
the SAME signal with the SAME message: a merge whose chunks were ALL
rejected as hallucinations is refused, the file is never written, and the
refusal names the size/split remedy.

The convention this gate consumes lives in ``chunked_merge``: on
retry-exhaustion the merge returns ``merged_code`` set to the ORIGINAL
file with ``parse_valid=False`` and ``chunks_rejected >= chunks_used`` —
error-shaped, so a parse gate alone cannot refuse it (the original parses
like the original, by definition). Only the chunk accounting can.
