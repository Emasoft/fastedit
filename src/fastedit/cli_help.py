"""Single source of truth for the ``fastedit --help`` guide.

This module holds the guide as structured data (``SECTIONS``, ``COMMANDS``) and
renders it into the ``EPILOG`` string that ``fastedit.cli`` passes to argparse.
Tests in ``tests/test_cli_help.py`` guarantee that every example command parses
against the real CLI parser (no invented flags) and that the troubleshooting
entries quote error strings that really exist in ``src/``.

Keep every rendered line at 100 characters or fewer — the data below is
hand-wrapped, and the tests enforce the width.
