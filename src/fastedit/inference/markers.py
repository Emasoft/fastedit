"""Single source of truth for keep-marker detection (B15 unification).

Every question "is this line a marker?" in the codebase is answered by
:func:`is_marker_line` in this module. Before this module existed, three
definitions coexisted and disagreed:

  * ``text_match._is_marker`` matched marker phrases by SUBSTRING
    containment, so a real comment like
    ``x = compute(a)  # ... see docs for details`` was misclassified as a
    keep-marker: it was swallowed from the merge output and its presence
    suppressed preserved-suffix emission (B15).
  * ``chunked_merge._is_marker_line`` had the same substring defect in
    the validator's view (feeding B14).
  * ``chunk_locator._narrow_large_node`` carried its own private copy.

The rule here is LINE-ANCHORED: a line is a marker iff its stripped
content exactly equals one of the canonical marker phrases, or it is a
bare short-form marker (``#...``, ``//...``, ``…``). A marker phrase
embedded mid-line is content, never an instruction.

:func:`normalize_markers` rewrites short/Unicode marker forms to the
canonical long form before downstream processing. It is a pure string
transform with one guard (B18): the rewrite is decided against a
string-span-masked copy of the snippet (:func:`split_join.mask_string_spans`),
so a marker-LOOKING line inside a multi-line string — an embedded template
or shell script — is user data and is never rewritten.

    Legacy long-form markers (``# ... existing code ...``,

    Indentation is preserved on the rewritten line so downstream indent
    arithmetic in ``deterministic_edit`` (which uses marker snippet
    indent to infer gap-body indent deltas) continues to match the
    surrounding snippet lines.

    This is a pure string transform — no parsing, no I/O, no side
    effects. Safe to call on any input.

    String awareness (B18): the per-line rewrite decision runs against a
    string-span-masked copy of the snippet (:func:`split_join.mask_string_spans`),
    so a line whose text lives inside a multi-line string (an embedded
    template or shell script) can never match a marker form and is passed
    through untouched. Masking is a same-length, 1:1 substitution that
    keeps every ``\\r``/``\\n`` in place, so the masked text splits into
    exactly the same lines as the original. A match against the masked body
    implies the marker text itself is unmasked — masking cannot forge the
    ``#``/``.``/``…`` characters of a marker — so the indent taken from the
    masked body is genuine when a rewrite fires.
