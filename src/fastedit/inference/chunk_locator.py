"""Chunk location: finds which regions of a file to extract and merge.

Given a snippet and original file, uses AST analysis to determine the
minimal chunk(s) that need to be sent to the model.

Step D2 adds the AST-less branch: when no grammar resolves (``.txt``,
``.log``, any language the resolver honestly cannot parse), the snippet's
UNIQUE context lines act as anchors and each anchor yields a chunk window
sized to the measured model context budget (:data:`_MAX_TEXT_CHUNK_LINES`).
A structureless file of ANY size becomes editable; with no anchor the
whole-file chunk (and its fail-loud >150-line gate) is kept — nothing
declares where the edit goes, so the only safe behavior is to refuse.

"""The per-chunk line budget for AST-less text windows.

Token-budget derivation (NO tokenizer dependency — a MEASURED estimate
from the real fastedit mlx-8bit model, tests/test_real_llm_text_chunks.py
and the Step A1 probe): the model has a 40 960-token context and A1
measured a ~150-line prose chunk at ~1 713 prompt tokens, so context
headroom is not the binding constraint — the model's GENERATION envelope
is. Measured: a ~400-line window fills the 16 384-token output cap
without converging (truncated on every attempt); ~120-line windows apply
the edit but lossily drop or reinvent untouched lines (content-
faithfulness rejections on every attempt); the measured converging
envelope for prose merges is the D1 whole-file shape (tests/
test_real_llm_text.py: a 37-line natural-prose file merges byte-exact).
40 lines keeps an entry's paragraph plus its neighbours inside that
envelope (~460 prompt tokens — ~90x context headroom), while larger
edits simply get more windows. A tokenizer-dependent budget would add a
model-loading cost to every locate for no measured benefit; the window's
bytes are re-checked span-locally by the validation battery anyway.

The budget bounds the CONTEXT around an anchor cluster, not the cluster
itself: a merged window's own anchor span (the lines between the
snippet's anchors, which marker-bearing gaps may hide content in) is the
floor — see :func:`_text_anchor_windows`. Two further measured shape
constraints surfaced by the real-model probes (documented in
tests/test_real_llm_text_chunks.py): the window the model re-emits must
not repeat a line within itself (its edges are therefore trimmed to
content lines — :func:`_trim_window_to_content` — and the corpus's text
dialect draws stride-disjoint body sentences), and prose merges converge
for the marker-free insertion shapes while the marker-bearing replace
idiom echoes the marker at every window size (a model limitation the
battery rightly rejects — the tests pin the insertion shapes).

    the matcher here only answers "which snippet lines pinpoint a
    location", and it does so with the two properties windowing needs:

      * **uniqueness** — the stripped line occurs exactly once in the
        original. A line with several occurrences cannot locate a window
        (which occurrence would the edit target?), and picking one would
        be the duplicated-paragraph trap (the GIGO corpus keeps
        pre-existing duplicates; a wrong-occurrence window would hand the
        model the wrong copy). Uniqueness makes the whole class of
        wrong-occurrence cuts impossible instead of heuristic.
      * **forward-scan order** — the anchors' original positions are
        strictly increasing, the SAME binding rule the battery's
        classifier uses (``_classify_snippet_raw``'s cursor). An anchor
        the battery could never bind as context would classify as a NEW
        line and make every merge of the window unfaithful, so it must
        not anchor a window either: one binding logic, two consumers.

    predicate) and lines shorter than :data:`_MIN_TEXT_ANCHOR_LENGTH` are

    Returns ``(start_line, end_line)`` (1-indexed, inclusive), always
    constrained to the node's own span: either the sub-block the snippet
    clearly targets, or the FULL node range when the narrow cannot be
    trusted (callers treat the full range as "send the whole node").

    B27 contract (Step 17): the narrow is trusted only when the snippet's
    non-marker lines match a contiguous window of the node with score
    ≥ ``_MIN_NARROW_SCORE`` AND tree-sitter can name the enclosing block
    around that window. The cut boundaries are then that block's AST node
    edges — never a ±``padding`` raw-line window, which cut mid-block and
    handed the model a broken fragment to "repair". Without a confident
    window match, without ``original_code``/``language`` to parse, or
    without an enclosing block, the narrow is REJECTED and the full node
    range is returned.

    ``padding`` is retained for API compatibility and is now a no-op:
    raw line-count padding was exactly the mid-block cut this function no
    longer performs (same deprecation pattern as ``deterministic_edit``'s
    ``max_drop_gap``).

    C3 fix (wrong-sub-block cut): the cut anchors on the FIRST MATCHED
    line of the best-scoring window, not on the window's first line. A
    snippet whose leading lines match nothing at the window position —
    concretely: ``replace=`` on a >100-line symbol where the auto-prepended
    signature (see ``chunked_merge``) occupies the window's first slot, or
    any snippet with leading declared-new lines — used to slide the window
    one-or-more lines past its true alignment and then anchor the
    enclosing-block lookup on a bystander line, cutting the WRONG
    sub-block of the large node (found by the C3 deep-nesting stress: the
    model was handed block A while the snippet edited block B, and every
    attempt was rejected to exhaustion). Anchoring on the first matched
    line is a no-op for snippets whose first line is a real context match
    (the whole-symbol wrap shapes).
