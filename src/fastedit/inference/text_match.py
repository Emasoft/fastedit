"""Deterministic text-match editing: zero model tokens.

Classifies snippet lines as context (matches original) or new (the edit).
Forward-scans through the original to find context positions, then splices
new lines between them.

PRESERVE-BY-DEFAULT semantics: a snippet declares an edit, it does not
license deletion. Unmentioned original lines always survive.

  - Leading section (before the first anchor): originals are preserved;
    leading new lines are inserted before the first anchor — except for
    the explicit signature/prefix-replacement case (below), where the
    leading new lines replace the original prefix in place.
  - Mid sections (between two anchors): the original gap is preserved
    verbatim, whitespace-only lines included. With a marker, new lines
    declared before the marker are inserted immediately after the
    preceding anchor (top of gap) and lines declared after the marker
    follow the gap; the marker itself never emits content. Without a
    marker the section is a protected insertion zone: new lines are
    emitted after the preserved gap, immediately before the next anchor.
  - Trailing section: the original suffix is ALWAYS preserved; trailing
    new lines are inserted immediately after the last anchor, before the
    preserved tail. A trailing marker is the coarse "keep everything
    after this point" idiom and is insertions-only.
  - In-place replacement is the ONLY sanctioned deletion: a new line
    replaces an original line when it restates it exactly (same
    normalized content AND indent, exactly one candidate), or — inside a
    mid marker-bearing section only — when it is uniquely identified by
    ``(replacement_key, indent)`` (the v0.2.3 contract).
  - AMBIGUOUS-REWRITE DECLINE: in a marker-free section a new line that
    looks like a rewrite of a preserved line (same assignment LHS key or
    same leading token, without restating it exactly) is ambiguous — the
    editor declines (returns None) rather than emitting either a
    duplicate or a deletion.
  - STRUCTURAL-BALANCE DECLINE: the merged span must not change the
    bracket balance of the original span; an imbalance caused by inserted
    lines (e.g. a duplicated closer) declines to the model path.

Falls back to None (model required) when <2 context anchors are found, when
any decline above fires, or when two candidate anchor bindings remain equally
valid after disambiguation (B24): each context line binds to one of ALL its
forward original occurrences — the one keeping the anchor sequence contiguous
with its neighbors and matching the snippet line's indent — and a tie between
bindings is a guess about where the edit belongs, so it is never resolved
silently.

    """True when a snippet contains a line that IS a keep-marker.

    This predicate REFUSES to write a file, so its two failure directions are
    NOT symmetric and the design follows that asymmetry:

      * false POSITIVE -- refuses a valid snippet. Loud, recoverable: the user
        passes the full replacement body instead.
      * false NEGATIVE -- lets a partial snippet reach the direct-replacement
        splice, which deletes every original line the snippet did not restate.
        SILENT, exit 0, code lost.

    Where the two cannot both be satisfied, err toward refusing.

    THREE earlier versions were each MEASURED wrong, and every failure but the
    first was in the silent direction:

      * substring containment refused a valid body whose DOCSTRING merely
        mentioned the phrase -- proving it by refusing the very edit that fixed
        it, since this project documents markers in its own docstrings.
      * `startswith` on the stripped line missed a marker sitting after code;
        end-to-end that truncated a four-line body to one, exit 0.
      * a quote-in-prefix test missed BOTH a marker after an ordinary comment
        containing an apostrophe (`don't`, `won't`, `it's` -- routine English)
        and a marker after any earlier string literal on the same line.

    Each of those was a threshold guess. This is not: a marker only means
    anything inside a COMMENT, so find where the comment actually starts by
    scanning the line with quote state, then look for the marker after it.
    That is the property itself rather than a proxy for it.

    KNOWN LIMIT, accepted and deliberate: a marker alone on its own line inside
    a multi-line string is still treated as a marker, because seeing that needs
    a real parser. That is the LOUD direction -- it refuses a valid snippet
    rather than losing code -- and it is far rarer than the cases above.

    Anchors are the snippet's context-eligible lines in order, each with

    candidate per anchor, strictly increasing (the forward scan's
    order-preserving guarantee), and every consecutive pair must pass the
    Fix-D indent-delta consistency check that the old sequential scan
    applied against the previous anchor.

    Among the feasible bindings the optimum minimizes, lexicographically:

      1. lost adjacencies — transitions where the next anchor is not the
         very next original line, negated: the binding that keeps the
         snippet's anchor sequence contiguous (anchors landing together

      2. total span — the distance from the first to the last bound line;
      3. indent mismatches — anchors whose original indent differs from
         the snippet line's (column width, tabs expanded): the occurrence
         written at the snippet's own indent wins.

    Ties are resolved by REGION, not silently:

      * Optimal bindings sharing the same first AND last anchor positions
        describe the same region — the residual ambiguity is only which
        duplicate line inside that region an anchor binds to, which
        cannot move the edit across regions. Those resolve to the
        earliest candidate per anchor (the legacy first-forward choice
        within the region), so byte-identical merges (repeated adjacent
        lines) keep working.
      * Optimal bindings with different region endpoints would place the
        edit in different parts of the original — choosing one is a guess,
        and the caller declines.
