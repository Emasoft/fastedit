"""Encoding-safe source I/O: read_source / write_source.

Every read that feeds an edit used to decode with ``errors="replace"``
(B21): each undecodable byte became U+FFFD and was written back as
EF BF BD — permanent corruption of lines the edit never touched. Every
write used to encode UTF-8 regardless of how the file was decoded (B23).
This module is the single sanctioned read/write pair for source files:

* detection order: BOM sniff (reusing ``filetype``'s BOM table) → binary
  gate (reusing ``filetype.detect_file_type``'s classification) → strict
  UTF-8 → latin-1;
* decode is STRICT everywhere — no ``errors=`` argument survives here. A
  file is either decoded exactly (UTF-8, UTF-8-BOM, latin-1) or refused;
* UTF-16/UTF-32 and binary content raise
  :class:`UnsupportedEncodingError` with a message that says the file was
  not modified — a UTF-16 file must never reach tree-sitter as mojibake;
* ``write_source`` encodes with the SAME codec that decoded the file, so
  ``read_source`` → edit → ``write_source`` is a byte-exact round-trip
  outside the edited span (B23).

    """Read a source file and return ``(text, encoding)``.

    With ``return_stat=True`` returns ``(text, encoding, stat)`` where
    *stat* is the ``os.stat_result`` captured via ``os.fstat`` from the
    SAME open the bytes were read through. Pass it to
    ``mcp.backup._atomic_write(expected_stat=...)`` so the write can refuse
    (B37 lost-update guard) when the file changed on disk between this read
    and the write. The default stays the 2-tuple so existing callers are
    untouched.

    Detection order:

    1. empty file → ``("", "utf-8")``;
    2. BOM sniff, in ``filetype._BOM_TEXT_ENCODINGS`` order: a UTF-8 BOM
       selects the ``utf-8-sig`` codec (the codec strips the BOM on decode
       and re-adds it on encode, which is what makes the round-trip exact);
       a UTF-16/UTF-32 BOM is refused;
    3. binary gate: ``filetype.detect_file_type`` must classify the content
       as text. This catches no-BOM UTF-16 (dense with NUL bytes, per
       filetype's heuristic) and true binary before any codec is chosen;
    4. strict UTF-8;
    5. latin-1 — filetype's remaining text class ("decodable as latin-1
       with a low control-byte ratio"). latin-1 maps every byte to the same
       codepoint, so the decode is total and re-encoding is byte-exact.
       (cp1252 is deliberately NOT used: it has five undefined code points
       that would not round-trip.)
